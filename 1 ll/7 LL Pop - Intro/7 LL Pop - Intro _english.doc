To streamline the script for recording and animation based on your provided transcript, I'll maintain minimal changes while ensuring clarity. Here's a refined version broken down into segments as required:

### Intro
In this tutorial, we'll explore the logic behind implementing a `pop` method in a linked list. We'll discuss the necessary steps and identify key edge cases to consider when removing an item from the end of the list.

### A1: Understanding the Pop Method
The `pop` method is fundamentally about removing the last item from a linked list and adjusting the `tail` pointer. Unlike simpler methods like `push`, `pop` requires more steps:
1. Identify and remove the item at the end of the list.
2. Move the `tail` pointer to the previous node.
3. Return the item that was removed.

### A2: Handling Edge Cases
There are several scenarios that require special attention:
- **Empty List**: If the list is empty (i.e., the head is `null`), there is nothing to pop, and the method should return `undefined`.
- **Single Item List**: Special care is needed when the list contains only one item. After popping, both `head` and `tail` should be set to `null`.

### A3: Implementation Details
To implement the `pop` method effectively, we must traverse the list from the beginning to find the second-to-last item:
- Set `tail.next` to `null` to detach the last node.
- Adjust the `tail` pointer to the new last node.
- The method must iterate through the entire list to adjust the `tail`, making this an O(n) operation due to its linear time complexity.

### Outro
In the next video, we'll dive into the coding aspect of this method, applying the logic we've discussed here to create a robust `pop` function for our linked list.
