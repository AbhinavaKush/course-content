We'll just set it equal to head.

We have to start at the beginning of the list.

Then we can iterate through the list, however many items we need to to get to the item at the index

that we're looking for.

So we do that by saying let temp equal this dot head.

And then I'm going to remove head and tail here and just leave temp here.

And then we have a for loop to iterate through this list, and all the for loop does is move the temp

variable forward.

So say we're looking for the item at the index of two.

It would run the for loop one two times and then return the item.

That is pointing to it would return temp.

So that is all of our code for get.

The only tricky part of this method is to remember to write this if statement for anything that's out

of the acceptable range.

But other than that, it's a pretty straightforward method.

So when we flip over to Chrome DevTools, we're going to build out a linked list that just looks like

this, where the index and the value is going to be the same for every node.

So let's flip over to Chrome DevTools.

So there's our Get method.

And this is where we build our linked list.

0323.

So let's run this.

And let's open this up.

Make sure our link list looks the way we expect it to.

Head is pointing to a node with a value of zero.

Tail is pointing to a value of three and we have a length of four.

So that is perfect.

So we'll say my link list dot get.

And I'm going to pass it a value of negative one.

And it returns undefined, just like we would expect.

And then I'm also going to try a value here that is greater than our range.

So let's try the index of ten.

And that also returns undefined.

So that's perfect.

And then let's have a valid index.

So the node at the index of two is going to have a value of two.

And that is exactly what we expect.

So that is our method for get.
