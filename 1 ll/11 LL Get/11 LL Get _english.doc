**Intro:**
Welcome to our tutorial on implementing the `get` method in a linked list. Let's dive into how you can retrieve a node by its index in a linked list.

**A1:**
Firstly, we'll define our starting point:
```javascript
let temp = this.head;
```

**A2:**
Now, let's iterate through the list to find the node at our desired index. We use a simple for loop to navigate through:
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < index; i++) {
    temp = temp.next;
}
```

**A3:**
Once we reach the correct node, our `temp` variable will reference it, allowing us to return its value:
```javascript
return temp;
```

**Outro:**
That's it for the `get` method. Simple, right? Remember, always check your index bounds to handle any requests that are out of range. Next up, we'll explore how to modify nodes with the `set` method. Stay tuned!
