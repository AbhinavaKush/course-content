**Intro:**
Welcome to the exciting world of data structures, starting with linked lists. Unlike arrays, linked lists offer unique functionalities and advantages that we will explore.

**A1 - Comparison with Arrays:**

**Indexing:**
Arrays provide direct indexing, allowing quick access to elements at specific positions. In contrast, linked lists lack indexes, requiring sequential traversal to reach a specific element.

**Memory Allocation:**
Arrays require contiguous memory blocks, which enhances access speed but can cause allocation issues as the array expands. Linked lists, scattered across memory, support dynamic growth without needing contiguous space.

**A2 - Visual Representation and Terminology:**

We represent arrays as green squares and linked lists as purple circles to illustrate their structural differences visually.

**Key Variables:**
- **Head:** The first node.
- **Tail:** The last node, which points to null, signaling the end of the list.

**A3 - Advantages of Linked Lists:**

Linked lists excel in dynamic applications due to their flexible memory allocation. They are efficient in environments that require frequent insertions and deletions, where such operations do not necessitate reorganizing the entire structure.

**Outro:**
Understanding the differences between linked lists and arrays is crucial for selecting the most suitable data structure based on efficiency, memory management, and data access needs.
