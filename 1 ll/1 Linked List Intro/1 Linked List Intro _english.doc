**Intro:**

Welcome to linked lists! Today, we embark on our exciting journey into data structures by building our first one: the linked list. We'll compare it to a more familiar structure—the array—to better understand its unique advantages.

**A1:**
Linked lists and arrays often serve similar functions but in fundamentally different ways. To illustrate, let’s transform an array into a linked list:

- First, remove the indexes. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not have indexed access.
- Next, understand that arrays occupy contiguous memory slots, but linked lists do not. Their elements can be scattered anywhere in memory, providing flexibility.

**A2:**
To visualize the transition:
- We'll represent array elements as green squares and switch to purple circles for linked list elements.
- Introduce two special variables: `head`, pointing to the first element, and `tail`, pointing to the last. Each element—or node—then points to the next node in the sequence.

**A3:**
This sequence continues until the last node, which points to `null`, creating what is known as a null-terminated list. This concept is crucial as it marks the end of the linked list.

**A4:**
Recap the memory allocation:
- Arrays are stored contiguously, making them quick at indexed access.
- Linked lists, scattered throughout memory, excel at dynamic insertion and deletion as they don’t require reorganization of the entire structure.

**Outro:**
That’s a brief overview of linked lists compared to arrays! Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right data structure based on your needs for memory management and performance.
