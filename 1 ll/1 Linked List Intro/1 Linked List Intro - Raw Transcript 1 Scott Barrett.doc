Welcome to linked lists.

This is going to be our first data structure that we build which is kind of exciting.

And in order to introduce linked lists, I'm going to compare this to the data structure that it is

most often compared to.

And that is arrays.

So I'm going to take this array and I'm going to turn this into a linked list.

So one of the things that arrays have that linked lists don't are indexes.

So I'm going to remove the indexes.

Also, arrays are in contiguous places in memory.

But linked lists aren't.

They can be all over the place.

So I'm going to spread these out.

And then one of the things I like to do when we move to a new data structure is represented graphically

in a different way.

So instead of green squares I'm going to use purple circles.

Linked lists also have a variable called head that points to the first item, and one called tail,

that points to the last item.

Then each item in the linked list points to the next, to the next to the next, and the last one is

going to point to null.

So you will hear the phrase null terminated list.

So this is an example of that.

So I had mentioned before that arrays are in contiguous places in memory.

Linked lists are not.

They can be all over the place in memory where an array is going to be in a contiguous place in memory.

So that's just a quick overview of linked lists and how they compare to arrays.
