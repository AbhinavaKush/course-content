**Intro:**
Welcome, everyone! Today, we're tackling a classic interview question: reversing a linked list. This operation is fundamental in understanding linked list manipulations. Let's dive into the method to reverse a linked list completely.

**Body:**
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We start by understanding our linked list's structure. Our aim is to switch the head with the tail and then reverse the direction of all node pointers.
   
2. **Swapping Head and Tail:**
   - Initially, we create a temporary variable `temp` and set it to the current head.
   - We then set the head to point to the tail and the tail to what was initially the head using `temp`.
   - This is just the preliminary step. The main challenge is reversing the pointers of each node.

3. **Reversing Node Pointers:**
   - To reverse the node pointers, we introduce two more variables: `next` and `previous`.
   - `next` will keep track of the node following `temp`, and `previous` will initially be set to null.
   - We then enter a loop to adjust the pointers:
     ```javascript
     while (temp != null) {
       next = temp.next;       // Move next to the next node
       temp.next = previous;   // Reverse the pointer
       previous = temp;        // Move previous to the current node
       temp = next;            // Proceed to the next node
     }
     ```
   - This loop continues until all nodes have been processed and their pointers reversed.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Once all nodes are reversed, `previous` will point to the new head of the list.
   - We ensure the linked list's head pointer is updated to `previous`, marking the end of the reversal process.

**Outro:**
And there you have itâ€”a linked list reversed from start to finish! This method is a great exercise for understanding dynamic data structures and pointer manipulation. Next, we'll head over to Chrome DevTools to test our reversed linked list visually. Stay tuned!
