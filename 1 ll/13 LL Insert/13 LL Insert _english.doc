**Intro:**
Hello, and welcome to our tutorial on the `insert` method in linked lists. This method allows you to add a new node with a specific value at any position in the list. Ready to learn how to implement it? Let’s dive in.

**Body:**
We begin by understanding where to insert the new node based on the given index. Let's explore the scenarios:

1. **Insert at the Beginning:**
   - If the index is zero, we simply use the `unshift` method to add the node at the beginning. This is done by:
     ```javascript
     if (index === 0) return this.unshift(value);
     ```
   - The `unshift` method handles adding the node and adjusts the linked list accordingly.

2. **Insert at the End:**
   - To add a node at the end of the list, we check if the index matches the length of the list and use the `push` method:
     ```javascript
     if (index === this.length) return this.push(value);
     ```
   - This appends the new node and updates the `tail` reference.

3. **Insert in the Middle:**
   - For insertion at any middle position, we first locate the node just before the desired index using the `get` method:
     ```javascript
     let temp = this.get(index - 1);
     ```
   - If `temp` is `null`, indicating an out-of-bound index, we return `false`.
   - Otherwise, we create the new node and adjust the pointers:
     ```javascript
     let newNode = new Node(value);
     newNode.next = temp.next;
     temp.next = newNode;
     ```

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - Increase the length of the list by one.
   - Return `true` to indicate successful insertion.

**Outro:**
And that's how you implement the `insert` method! This method is versatile, allowing for insertion at any valid index. Use this method to dynamically modify your linked list as needed. In our next session, we'll test this method in Chrome DevTools to see it in action. Stay tuned!
