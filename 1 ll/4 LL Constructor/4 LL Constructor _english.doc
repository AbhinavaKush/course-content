**Introduction: Building the Linked List Constructor**

Welcome to our session on building a linked list constructor. Today, we'll begin by defining our linked list class.

```javascript
class LinkedList {
  constructor(value) {
    // Code initialization
  }
}
```

Before diving into the constructor's code, letâ€™s discuss its significance and commonalities with methods like `push`, `unshift`, and `insert`. Each of these operations involves creating a new node, and they all accept a value as their input. To avoid redundancy in our code, we will implement a separate class solely for creating nodes.

**Creating the Node Class**

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

By encapsulating the node creation in its own class, we simplify the node generation process across different list methods. Now, let's return to our main class and build out the constructor using our `Node` class.

**Implementing the Linked List Constructor**

```javascript
constructor(value) {
  const newNode = new Node(value);
  this.head = newNode;
  this.tail = this.head;  // Initially, the tail is the same as the head
  this.length = 1;  // Starting with one node
}
```

This setup immediately creates a new node when a new linked list is instantiated, setting both the head and tail to this new node and initializing the list length to one.

**Demonstration in Developer Tools**

Let's visualize this in the Developer Tools. Here's how you create a linked list instance:

```javascript
let myLinkedList = new LinkedList(4);
```

This line initializes a linked list with a single node having a value of 4, where both head and tail reference this node, and the length is set to 1. Observing this in the console confirms our setup is correct, displaying the linked list structure clearly.

**Conclusion**

With the linked list constructor and node class effectively set up, our data structure is ready to handle more complex operations like adding and removing elements, which we'll explore in upcoming tutorials.
