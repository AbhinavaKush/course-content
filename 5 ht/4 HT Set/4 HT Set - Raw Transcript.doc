Okay.

So the next thing we need to do is build this empty array that we will push the key value pairs into.

And we'll just do it like this.

So this line here, this dot data map at the index of four, we want to create this empty array like

this.

And this is a step that we only want to do if there isn't already an empty array in there.

So if we were going to insert something else at the index of four, we wouldn't want to do this step.

So we'll wrap this in an if statement like this.

So this is basically saying if this is completely empty, only then will we do this.

Now we can push in our key value pair and we'll do it like this.

We'll walk through this, this data map.

Index.

And this is the index of four.

We're going to push the key value pair.

The array with these two items.

So that gets pushed into there.

Now let's look at adding another key value pair to the same address.

We'll run the set method pass it a key and a value.

In this case it's going to be washers.

First thing we have to do is run the hash to see what address that it's going to be.

And the index for washers with the hash method that we're using is also going to return four.

So index is going to be set to four.

Then we move to this if statement.

Is there already something at the address before there is, which means we are not going to do this

step.

And we're going to move to this step and it's going to push this key value pair.

Into their.

And then I'm just going to add one more key value pair.

This will go at the index of six.

There is one more line of code that we need to add and that is to return.

The hash table.

When we move over to Chrome DevTools, we're going to use this code and we're going to build an empty

hash table with seven items in it, just like this.

And then we're going to use the set method to put all three of these key value pairs into the hash table.

And then we'll take a look at the hash table.

So let's flip over to DevTools.

Okay.

There's our set method that we just created.

And then the hash table that we're going to create here is just going to be an empty hash table.

So let's zoom out here.

I'll go over here and run this.

And I'm just going to open this and show that this.

Is an empty hash table with a length of seven, and I'll clear this.

And I'll just use the up arrow.

I've got these saved here.

We have lumber that's going to go at the index of six washers.

And bolts.

Okay.

So I'm going to clear this.

Then I'm just going to say my hash table.

And I'll press enter.

Now, when we open this up.

You can see that we have two items at the index of four there.

I'll open this up.

And those are our washers and our bolts.

And down here at the index of six.

We have lumber.

And that is our method for set.
