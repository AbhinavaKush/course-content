Now we're going to write our pivot code.

So we're going to use this same array like this.

And I'm going to shrink it down.

So we have room for our code.

Now, one of the things that we're having to do in a couple of different places in pivot is swap two

items.

So you can do that with three lines of code like this.

But since we're going to use this twice, I am going to make it its own function.

We're going to pass it an array and the first index, and the second index of the items that we're going

to swap.

And this is going to take care of that.

So this is going to make our pivot code a little bit cleaner.

So let's start the pivot code itself.

Now we have three arguments here.

The only one that you have to pass it is the array.

Because these two are going to default to what they're going to need to be when you pass it the array.

Anyway, the index of the first item in the array is going to be zero, and the index of the last item

in the array is going to be the length minus one.

So you don't have to worry about these when you are passing the array to the pivot function.

But the reason we have this is we saw that we're going to run quicksort after the first time through

on a subsection of the array, and we have to know the first and last index of that section of the array

that we are working on then.

And that's why we have to have this here.

So I'm going to bring in our first variable pivot.

That's going to be this.

So the variable is pivot index to emphasize that this is an index.

But on the arrow I'm just putting pivot to make that easier.

Then we're going to start out with the swap index being equal to the pivot index.

Like this.

Then we'll have our for loop.

And here is I from the for loop it's going to be the pivot index plus one.

And we're going to run this loop until we get to the end index.

So then we start doing comparisons.

If the value at the index of I is less than the value at the pivot index, we're going to do something.

So in this case that's not true.

I'm just going to color this in gray and move the I over.

In this case it is less than.

And when that is the case we're going to do two things inside of this if statement.

We're going to move swap over like this.

And then we're going to use that swap function.

Like this where we pass it the array, the swap index and I and it will swap those two items.

And then we're going to keep going through this for loop until the array is going to look like this.

And the next thing is we're going to call that swap function and switch these two items.

And now there's one thing left to do and that is to return that swap index.

Which means this function, in addition to rearranging all of the numbers to be like we have at the

bottom of the screen, it is also going to return the value of three.

So that is our code for pivot.

And this is going to be the result that it returns.

But we're going to start like this.

Now let's go over and look at all of this in DevTools.

So there is our swap function, and our pivot function is here.

And we're going to run pivot with my array, which is the array that we had just looked at.

And I'm going to zoom out here and run this.

And it's going to return the number three.

That's that index.

But let's also look at my array.

And there is the array with the four in the middle, and everything on the left is less than four and

everything on the right is greater than four.

And that is our function for pivot.
