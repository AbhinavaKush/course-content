Okay.

So now let's code quicksort I'm going to bring up our array like this.

So right out of the gate when we run pivot we're going to have our pivot item like this.

And it's going to sort it like this.

And it's going to return this index.

What we have to do with quicksort is to continue doing that on this side.

And this side and keep breaking this down until we have sorted everything.

So I'm going to put our array back the way it was and then shrink it down into the corner like this.

So I'm going to bring the function in like this.

Just like with pivot, you only have to pass it an array to begin with.

It is only when we start calling this recursively that you have to worry about that left and right up

there.

So in our first line of code that I'm going to bring in here, we're going to store that index.

That pivot returns.

Like this and we are passing pivot these three pieces of information and it's doing two things.

It is rearranging our array like that.

But it's also returning that index.

And we are storing it in pivot index.

And with that piece of information.

We can call quicksort recursively like this.

So if you look at our diagram at the bottom, it is these three items that it's being called on in this

situation.

When we have it call it again because left is zero and pivot index minus one is that last index in that

bracket.

And then we also need to call this on the items on the right and that we would do that like this.

And I'll bring up that bracket to represent that.

So let's bring this up and look at this a little bit further.

We're going to start on the left.

And we're going to have our pivot.

And that's going to be less than.

And that's going to be greater than.

And then we switch these two.

And then we're going to call it again.

But in this situation, you don't want to call quicksort again because you already know that these are

in the right spot.

That's going to be our base case.

And let's do this over here as well.

That's going to be our pivot.

That's greater than and that's less than.

We switch these and then we switch these.

And now we know that these two are on the right spot.

So we don't want to call quicksort on these either.

Also.

That is our base case.

So let's shrink this down.

The thing that we need to do here is have some kind of if statement.

So to make this work we're going to need this if statement where we say left has to be less than right.

So when what we just saw here.

What was left and right were the same item because there was only one item left.

And when that happens, we're not going to continue having quicksort call itself.

And now once we get to that point, we can just return the array.

So we'll look at this code in a moment.

Except we'll start with an array that looks like this.

Okay, so let's flip over to DevTools.

So there is our swap function that we wrote in the last section and our pivot helper function.

And I'm going to scroll up here and there is quicksort.

And we'll run it down here with that array.

And I'll zoom out.

And run this.

And there is our sorted array.

And that.

His quicksort.
