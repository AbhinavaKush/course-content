**Welcome to the Binary Search Tree Tutorial!**

Today, we're building the constructor for our binary search tree, starting with a simple node structure. Unlike the linked list where nodes contain `value` and `next`, a binary tree node includes `value`, `left`, and `right`.

Letâ€™s begin by creating the class for our binary search tree, focusing on the constructor:

```javascript
class BinarySearchTree {
    constructor() {
        // Initially, the root is set to null, indicating an empty tree.
        this.root = null;
    }
}
```

Initially, our tree is empty, represented by `this.root` set to `null`. Unlike arrays or linked lists where elements are linear, a binary search tree organizes data hierarchically. The root node, which we will create upon adding the first element, serves as the entry point to our tree structure. 

In the following segments, we'll delve deeper into methods like `insert` and `find`, allowing us to populate and interact with our tree effectively.

Stay tuned as we explore the dynamic world of binary search trees, ensuring our data remains organized for efficient retrieval.
