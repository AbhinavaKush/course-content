Now we're going to add a vertex to our graph.

Vertex is going to look like this.

And eventually we're going to have something that looks like this.

But in order to be able to have this, we're going to have to have edges.

And that will be a different method for creating edges between the vertices.

So we'll start with this which is actually going to look like this.

So I'm going to bring this down to the bottom and we can start writing our code.

We got to start with the class graph.

And I'm going to write out the constructor here as well.

The constructor is simple enough that it doesn't make sense to do a separate video for it, so I just

included it in this one.

This is the entire constructor.

We're just creating an empty object.

I'm calling it Adjacency List.

And that's it.

So the constructor is just going to create this.

The add vertex method is going to do this and put it into that empty object.

So I'll remove that and let's build the add vertex method.

So we'll pass it in this case the letter A.

Then we add it to our adjacency list object like this.

We set it equal to that empty array and that creates that vertex.

But we're not allowed to have duplicate vertices.

So we do have to wrap this in an if statement that says if there isn't already a vertex with this value,

then we can add that.

Also within the if statement, we will say return true that we were able to add that, otherwise we

will return false.

We'll take a look at this in DevTools in a moment, and we will create that vertex with a value of a.

So let's flip over to DevTools.

Okay.

And there is our constructor that creates that empty object and our add vertex method.

Then down here we're just going to create a new graph and it will be empty.

So let me run this.

And then let's come down here and open this.

And you can see that this adjacency list is empty.

So let's clear this.

And that we will add a vertex with the value of a.

It returns true that we were able to add that.

I'm just going to try to add this again.

To show that it is going to return false the second time, because second time around this is a duplicate.

So I'm going to clear this.

I'm going to say my graph.

And press enter.

And now let's open up the graph.

And now we have that new vertex with a value of a.

And that is our method for add vertex.
