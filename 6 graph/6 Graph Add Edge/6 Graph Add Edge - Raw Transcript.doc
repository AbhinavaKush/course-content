Now that we're able to create vertices, let's add edges between them.

So let's say we have these two vertices one and two.

That's going to look like this.

And we connect them with a new edge like this.

It's actually going to look like this.

That would be one and two connected to each other.

So let's remove this edge for now and actually build this with our code.

We'll say add edge.

We're going to need a vertex one and a vertex two that we're connecting to each other.

And in this case vertex one is going to be the value one.

The key is going to be one.

And vertex two is going to have the value of two.

To make things easy.

Then what we'll do is say vertex of one, the array that's attached to it.

We're going to push onto that array the value of vertex two, which in this case is actually two.

And then we'll do it the other way where we say on the vertex two, we're going to push on the value

of vertex one, which in this case is the value of one.

And that adds the edge.

But one of the things you can't do is create an edge between vertices that don't exist.

So if you try to add an edge between 1 and 3, that's not going to work, because we don't have a vertex

with the value of three.

So we'll wrap this in an if statement like this.

And we have to make sure that vertex one and vertex two actually exist.

And then we can do those two other steps to actually push those values into those arrays.

And then inside of the if statement we'll say return true.

Otherwise we're going to return false.

So let's take a look at this code in DevTools.

So there is our add edge method.

And we're going to create a new graph down here and create those two vertices one and two.

So I'm going to run this.

And then I'm going to open this.

And you can see we have our two vertices, one and two, but they are not connected to each other because

those two arrays are empty.

So I'll clear this.

So I'll say my graph dot add edge with the numbers one and two, I'll press enter.

And it returns true.

I'm also going to run this with one and three.

And you can see that this returns false because the three vertex does not exist.

So I'm going to clear this.

And then I'm going to say my graph.

And press enter.

Let's open this up.

And now each of these nodes are connected to each other, and we have been able to add an edge.
