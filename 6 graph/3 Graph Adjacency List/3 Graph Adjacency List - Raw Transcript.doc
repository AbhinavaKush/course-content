Now that we've looked at the adjacency matrix, this build out and adjacency list, I'm going to bring

up the same graph that we used before.

I'm just going to represent this in an adjacency list instead of an adjacency matrix.

And this is going to be very simple.

So we're going to store this in an object.

So we're going to start at the top there with a it is connected to B and e.

And in the object we will represent the vertex a and its edges like this.

So a is the key.

The edges will be b and e.

Now let's just move around this graph.

Let's look at b.

It is connected to a and c.

C is connected to b and d d is connected to Cnae.

And E is connected to a ND.

It's as simple as that.

And because this is so simple, this is what we're going to use in this course to represent our graph.

And that is our very quick overview of an adjacency list.
