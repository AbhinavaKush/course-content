Okay, so now let's write our DQ method.

DQ is just going to be removing that first item in the line.

This is very similar to shift with a linked list.

And remember with shift we had an edge case for if we had one node in our linked list.

Same is going to apply to queues and then we have to return undefined if there aren't any items in the

list at all.

So like I mentioned, it's like the shift method.

And you can copy a lot out of this.

Once again, I'll recommend that you try to write this from scratch.

And the first thing that you would do if you did that.

As you would change the name to DQ.

And as always, when we're going to remove something from a data structure.

If it is empty, we can't remove that item, so we'll return undefined.

Otherwise we will need a variable to point at the item that we're going to return.

So we'll say temp is equal to this dot first.

Like.

This.

Then we'll say if the length is one, we'll have first and last equal to null.

That is this situation where you have one item, we remove it.

We set first and last equal to null.

Then we say else.

First equals first.

Next.

That just moves first over to the next node.

And then temp next equals null.

So that is temp dot next equals null.

There will decrement the length.

And then we'll return temp.

So that's this item here.

We'll return that.

So we'll expect to get the number 11 back.

So we'll look at this code in a moment in DevTools.

And then we'll build out this same queue that we've been using in this video.

And remove this item.

So we should see the number 11 returned.

And then we'll look at our queue.

And first should be pointing to the node with the value of three.

So let's flip over to DevTools.

And there is our DQ method and this creates our queue with the values 11, three, 23 and seven.

So I'm going to zoom out here and run this.

And I'm just going to open this.

And the first node that's the one we're going to dequeue has the value of 11.

So I'm going to clear this.

That I'll run our DQ method.

And A returns the node with the value of 11.

Now let's look at the Q.

And we'll open this.

And now first is pointing to the node with the value of three.

So that is DQ
