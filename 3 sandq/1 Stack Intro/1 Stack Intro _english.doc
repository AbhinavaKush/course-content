**Intro**
This tutorial explains the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle using the concept of a stack. 

**A1**
LIFO is a method where the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Let's illustrate this with a simple example of stacking plates. As we add more plates, the stack grows, and when we need a plate, we take the top one from the stack.

**A2**
Consider you are browsing the internet. You first visit Facebook, then YouTube, then Instagram, and finally check your email. In this scenario, your browsing history represents a stack. If you start pressing the back button, you'll first go back to Instagram, then YouTube, and finally back to Facebook. This navigation mimics the stack operation where the most recent addition (last page visited) is accessed first.

**A3**
In computing, stacks are ubiquitous and can be implemented using different data structures. Though arrays can be used to implement a stack, they allow for insertion and removal of elements at the end in constant time \(O(1)\). However, using an array can be inefficient if elements are added or removed from the beginning, as this requires re-indexing the entire array.

**A4**
To demonstrate a more efficient way of implementing a stack, we'll use a linked list instead of an array. With a linked list, we add and remove elements from the same end, which ensures that both operations are performed in \(O(1)\) time.

**A5**
In this example, we'll write some code to show how you might implement a stack using a linked list. We'll modify the standard operations of a linked list—such as adding and removing elements from the top (or head) of the list—to fulfill the requirements of a stack.

**Outro**
That concludes our overview of using stacks in computing with a focus on the LIFO principle. Stacks are a fundamental data structure that you'll encounter frequently in both programming and various applications.
