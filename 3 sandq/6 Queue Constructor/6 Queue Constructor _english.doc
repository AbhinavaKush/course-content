**Intro:**  
"Welcome to our tutorial on constructing a queue similar to a linked list. Let's dive into the constructor details."

**A1:**  
"The first step in building our queue constructor is to create a node, which is identical to a node in a linked list, consisting of a value and a next pointer."

**A2:**  
"Like in linked lists, our queue constructor initializes by setting both `first` and `last` to the newly created node, indicating the start and end of the queue. Additionally, we set the length of the queue to one to account for the newly added node."

**A3:**  
"Now, let's see how this works in practice. We'll use DevTools to create a node with a value of four and observe how it functions as our queue's first and last element, demonstrating the constructor in action."

**Outro:**  
"That concludes our look at the queue constructor, highlighting its similarities to linked lists and its functionality in managing data efficiently."
