Okay.

So now we're going to build our pop method for our stack.

So it's going to look something like this.

We're going to pop that 11 node off of the top, and then move top down to the next item in the stack,

which is three.

And then three will become the top of the stack.

Okay.

So let's start coding this.

So the first thing we're going to have to determine is does this stack have items in it like this.

Or is it an empty stack like this because you can't pop anything off of an empty stack obviously.

So we're just going to say, if this dot length is equal to zero, then we're going to return undefined.

Then we're going to need a variable to point to the item that we're going to return.

So we'll say let temp equal this dot top that's going to look like this.

We're gonna have the temp variable point to the node that we're going to return.

Let's go back over here.

Then we're going to say.

This dot top equals this dot top dot next, which will look like this.

This dot top equals this dot top.

Like that dot next.

And that moves top down to point at the three node.

We say temp dot next equals null.

Let's take a look at that.

Temp.

Dot next.

Equals null, and that breaks that off from the rest of the stack.

Then we're going to decrement the length by one and we're going to return temp.

And when we return temp we are just returning this node that we popped from the stack.

So there's our code.

And let's look at this and DevTools.

Okay, there's our pop method.

And down here we've created a stack with seven, 23, three and 11.

So if we go back over here that is created this stack.

And I'm going to run pop from the command line, which should return this node.

So let's go back over here.

And I'm going to come down to the command line here, and I'm going to type in my stack dot pop, and

I'm going to press enter.

And there's the 11 node.

Now the next node that was in the stack was the three node.

So if we just type in my stack this will return the remainder of the stack.

So I'll press enter.

And the top item in that stack should be the number three.

And you can see here that the top node has a value of three.

So looks like we have a working method for pop.
