**Intro: Understanding Queues in Data Structures**

"Let's explore queues. Imagine standing in line; stepping into the line is known as enqueuing, and each new person stands behind the last. Removing someone from the line? That’s dequeuing. This operates on a FIFO basis—First In, First Out. Let's enqueue a few more people, and then we'll dequeue them.

**A1: Choosing the Right Data Structure for a Queue**

When considering data structures for implementing a queue, let’s begin with an array. Remember, pushing to or popping from the end of an array is an O(1) operation. However, to shift or unshift, which means adding or removing from the beginning, costs O(n). For a queue, you add at one end and remove from the other. The operations are efficient as long as they occur at opposite ends.

Using an array, you could enqueue at the back, an O(n) operation, and dequeue from the front, an O(1) operation, or vice versa. Either way, one operation will always be O(n).

**A2: The Efficiency of Linked Lists**

Now, compare this with a linked list. Popping from the end is O(n), but pushing is O(1). Conversely, both shifting (removing from the front) and unshifting (adding to the front) are O(1) operations. Therefore, the ideal setup for a queue using a linked list involves enqueuing at the back and dequeuing from the front, making both operations O(1). We refer to the ends of the linked list as 'first' and 'last' when discussing queues.

**Outro: Building Efficient Queues**

We’ll start with a linked list and tweak it to suit our queue implementation, maintaining efficient enqueue and dequeue operations. This setup ensures our data structure supports quick addition and removal, crucial for effective queue management in various applications."
