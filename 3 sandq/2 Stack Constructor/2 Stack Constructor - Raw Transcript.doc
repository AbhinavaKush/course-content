So now we're going to build our constructor for our stack.

So just like with linked lists, our first step is that we need to create a node.

And the node looks like this for the stack which is identical to what the node looked like for a linked

list.

And that means that our node class and the constructor in that class doesn't need any changes to it.

This is identical to the node class that we used in a linked list, because that's essentially what

we're using here is just a modified linked list.

Now we're going to see what else we can take from the linked list class.

So I'm going to start this out by saying class linked list.

Because we can just take that out of the linked list class.

But we would want to rename this.

To stack.

Now let's see what we can take from the constructor, from the linked list and what we can leave the

same and what needs to be changed.

So here's our constructor.

And the first thing that we had to do in our linked list constructor is the same thing that we need

to do here.

We need to create a node.

So up to this point, the only change that we've made is changing the name of the class from link List

to stack.

So just like with the linked list up to this point, we have created a node in the linked list.

The next thing we had was head and tail equal to the new node like that.

But we don't call them head and tail in a stack.

So I'm going to remove these.

And these would be called top and bottom.

And I'm not going to use bottom.

So I'm just going to go ahead and remove this and we'll just use top.

And then I'm going to say the length is equal to one.

And you could say height, but I'm just going to leave it at length.

One other change that I will make is that that icon for the 11 that we have on the lower right should

point down instead of across.

And there we have our code for a constructor for stack.

And there was a lot that we were able to reuse from the linked list constructor.

Now let's go over to DevTools and run this code.

This is where we create our new stack called My Stack.

And then the stack class of course, is calling the node class to create that first node.

Now let's go over here and run this.

And then I'm just going to type in my stack and press enter.

And there is our stack.

We have a stack where the top points to a node.

Length is equal to one.

Let's open this up.

And top is pointing to a node with a value of 11.

Where next is null.

So it looks like we have created a working constructor.
