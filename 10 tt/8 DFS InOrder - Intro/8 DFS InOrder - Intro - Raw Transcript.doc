So now we're going to do depth first search in order.

So we'll bring up our tree here.

And what we're going to do is we're going to start at the top as always.

And we are going to visit that first node.

And we're going to always go to the left first.

So we're going to do the 21.

It's going to go to the left and we go to the 18.

18 is going to try to go to the left.

There's nothing there.

And the next step is that we're going to write the value 18 to our array.

So I'm going to color that orange.

Then the 18 is going to try to go to the right.

And of course there's nothing there.

And we come back up to the 21.

It has already gone left.

Now we're going to write that value and then go right.

It's going to go left, write the value, try to go right, and then we come all the way back up to

the 47.

It's gone left.

Now it can write its value and it goes right.

And the first thing we always try to do if we can is go left.

So we go down to the 52 and then it tries to go left.

We write the value, tries to go right.

We come back up to the 76 and down to the 82.

It goes left, writes the value, tries to go right and we're done.

So I'm going to reset this all back and let's walk through the order.

That these were written to the array.

We started with the 18 that is the lowest number in that tree.

And then it was 21, the second lowest, and it goes from lowest.

To highest.

And that's why this is called depth first search.

In order.
