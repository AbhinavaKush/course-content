Now we're going to look at our first depth first search algorithm.

This one is going to be preorder later.

We're also going to look at post order and in order but this one will be preorder.

So let's walk through what preorder looks like I'm going to bring up a tree here.

And remember we're just going to take these and write them to an array.

It's just a matter of what order we do it in.

So preorder is going to start at the top and write that to the array.

And then it's going to go to the left.

It's always going to go to the left first if it can.

It's going to write that 21 to the array and then the 18.

And once we've done everything we can to the left, we're going to come back up to the 21 and we're

going to go to the right.

So now 47, that top node has done everything it can to the left.

Now it's going to start going to the right.

It's going to go to that 76 node.

And the 76 node is going to go to the left because we're going to go left first.

Now that we have everything on the left that the 76 can do, we're going to come back up to the 76 and

go to the right and add the 82 to the array, and that is preorder for depth first search.
