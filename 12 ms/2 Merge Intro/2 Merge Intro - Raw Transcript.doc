So in this video we're going to do a merge intro.

So merge is going to be a helper function that we're going to use in merge Sort.

So merge is going to look like this.

We have two sorted arrays and then we're going to put them into one big sorted array.

But let's look at the steps we have to do to make that happen.

One of them, we're going to use AI and the other we're going to use J.

And we're going to compare I with J.

And whichever one's lowest, we push that into the new array.

We're going to call that array.

Combined the combined array.

And then we do it again.

We compare I and J.

In this case J is going to be lower and we just keep doing that process.

So Jay is going to be the lowest here all the way to the end.

And we're done running through that array.

So this is going to break us out of that loop.

If either one of these get to zero items we're going to break out of that loop.

And then we're going to have a different loop that says while just this one array has items in it.

We're going to just push all of the items on until that array is empty.

And then, of course, we'll have another one that says if the other one has items in it, we will do

the same thing with the other array.

And that is our quick merge intro.
