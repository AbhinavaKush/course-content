So Merge Sort is going to be our first sorting algorithm that uses recursion.

And it leverages the idea that if you have two sorted arrays like this, these are two sorted arrays.

Combining two sorted arrays is fairly easy.

So what merge sort does is this.

Lets mix this up like this and move this to the top of the screen so we have more room.

It will take this array and it will cut it in half.

And then it will cut it in half again, and then it'll keep doing this until we have single item arrays.

Because a single item array is by definition sorted.

Then what we can do is take two of these.

And combine them into one larger sorted array.

And then we continue doing this all the way across like this.

Then we'll take these two arrays.

And combine them, and then we'll combine those two.

Now we can take these two sorted arrays and make one big sorted array out of these.

When you first look at this, you think, wow, that looks really inefficient to break all of this down

into single item arrays.

But it is actually an incredibly efficient sorting algorithm.

It's as efficient as you can make a sorting algorithm, actually.

So that is our quick overview.

Of merge sort.
