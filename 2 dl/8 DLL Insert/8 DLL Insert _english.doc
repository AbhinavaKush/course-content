Here's a refined script based on the detailed transcript you provided about inserting into a linked list:

**Intro**  
Welcome back! Today we're diving into a fundamental operation in data structures: inserting a new node into a linked list at a specific index. If you're coding along, feel free to pause the video as we go.

**A1**  
Just like in singly linked lists, we'll start with handling special cases. If we're inserting at the beginning, that's just an unshift operation. Here's the code:
```javascript
if (index === 0) {
    return this.unshift(value);
}
```
And if we're adding to the end, we use the push method:
```javascript
if (index === this.length) {
    return this.push(value);
}
```
Remember, both these operations need the `return` keyword to function correctly.

**A2**  
Now, for the standard insert. We aim to place a new node at a specific middle index, say, index 2. We first set up pointers to help us navigate:
```javascript
let newNode = new Node(value);
let beforeNode = this.get(index - 1);
let afterNode = beforeNode.next;
```

**A3**  
Next, we adjust the pointers to weave the new node into the list:
```javascript
newNode.next = afterNode;
beforeNode.next = newNode;
```

**A4**  
For a doubly linked list, it's similar, but we also need to update the previous pointers:
```javascript
newNode.prev = beforeNode;
if (afterNode) {
    afterNode.prev = newNode;
}
```

**Outro**  
And thatâ€™s it! We've successfully inserted a node in both singly and doubly linked lists. Always remember to increase the length of the list and return true to indicate success:
```javascript
this.length++;
return true;
```
In our next tutorial, we'll explore how to remove nodes from a linked list. Stay tuned!
