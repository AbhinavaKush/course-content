The only difference being the previous value.

So our constructor is going to look like this.

And the only difference in the constructor is going to be this line.

Now let's look at the linked list class and how it is that we built the constructor.

I'm going to focus in on the constructor like this.

And we built a new node.

And this is going to be the same for a doubly linked list.

This line of code doesn't change, it's just that the node class changed.

So when we create this node it's going to have next and previous.

And there's our node.

Except it's going to have another arrow.

Then we had head point the new node with this line of code.

And then we had tail.

Set to this dot head, so it's just pointing to the same thing head was pointing to.

And we made the length equal to one.

There is nothing that changes in the constructor.

The only thing that changes is in the node itself.

And that first line of code.

When we create the new node it is calling a different node class.

So let's bring back in these lines of code.

The only change that we would make here is to name this doubly linked list instead of linked list.

So we'll look at this code in a second in Chrome dev tools, and that we will also create a new doubly

linked list, starting with the node with the value of seven.

Okay, so there is our code.

And like I mentioned, the only difference is, is that the node has previous and that we change the

name from linked list to doubly linked list.

So we'll create our new linked list down here.

And I'm going to run this.

And has returned our linked list.

With a value of seven.

The difference here being that each of these nodes has next and previous.

Okay, so it looks like we have a working constructor.
