Okay.

So now we're going to do unshift.

So it's going to look like this.

We're going to have a new node that we create.

And then we'll have the next arrow on that one point to the first node in the list.

And we'll have the first node point back to it.

Move head over and that adds it into the list.

We can also have an empty list, in which case we just set head and tail equal to the new node.

So if you want to code this, pause it here.

Otherwise I'm going to get into the code.

So we start it with Unshift.

We're going to pass it a value.

And then we will create a new node with that value like this.

Then we will start with adding this into an empty linked list, where we just set head and tail equal

to that node.

So with this dot length equals zero we're going to set head and tail equal to the new node.

Else there is one or more items and we'll expand this else out and we'll bring up this list.

So we'll have the arrow from the new node point to that first node.

We'll do that with this line of code Newnode.next equals this dot head.

And then we'll have the other arrow reach back over to the new node with this line of code.

This dot head dot previous equals new node.

Then we'll move the head over with.

This dot head equals new node, and that adds that into the list.

So let's put this code in with the rest of our code so far.

Now we just need to increase the length by one.

And then return the entire linked list.

So we'll look at this code in a moment and DevTools and we will create this linked list.

With two and three.

Then we will unshift on a node with the value of one.

So let's flip over to DevTools.

So there is our Unshift method there.

And we're going to start out with a list with the items two and three.

Let's zoom out here and run this.

I'll just open this up.

I see we have values of two and three and a length of two.

So I'm going to clear this.

And I'm going to unshift on a node with the value of one.

So now let's open this.

Now.

Now you can see that head points to the value of one and our length is three.

So that is Unshift.
