Here's the refined script based on the segment you provided about the `unshift` operation in a linked list:

**Introduction**
Welcome to our exploration of linked list operations. Today, we're diving into the `unshift` method. This is particularly useful when you need to add a new node at the beginning of your linked list.

**A1: Understanding `unshift`**
Let's begin by visualizing what happens during the `unshift` operation:
1. **Creating a New Node**: We start by initializing a new node with the given value.
2. **Linking Nodes**: The new nodeâ€™s next pointer is set to currently point to the first node of the list, effectively inserting it at the beginning.

**A2: Handling an Empty List**
What if our list is initially empty? Simply:
- Set both the head and tail of the list to this new node.
- Now, the list contains just one node, which is both the head and the tail.

**A3: Writing the Code**
Let's put this into code:
- If the list is empty (`length == 0`), set `head` and `tail` to the new node.
- Otherwise, update the links:
  - `newNode.next = head` to point to the former first node.
  - `head.prev = newNode` to establish a two-way link.
  - Finally, update `head` to be the `newNode`.

**Outro**
In summary, `unshift` allows you to add new elements at the start of the list efficiently. Whether your list is empty or not, this operation ensures that the new node is properly linked, maintaining the integrity of the linked list.
