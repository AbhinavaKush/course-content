So now let's take a look at insertion sort.

So I'm going to bring up an array here.

And insertion sort always starts with the second item.

And then we compare it to the item before it.

In this case the four.

If it is less than the item that is before it we switch them like this.

And drop that in there.

Then we move to the next item.

In this case, the six is not less than four.

So that's going to stay put.

And now the five is less than the six.

We will move that over and then we'll compare the five to the four.

It's not less than the four.

So that's the spot where that goes.

And now the one is less than the six and the five and the four, and finally the two.

And we drop that in there.

And then one more item.

This is less than the six and the five and the four.

And we drop that in there.

And now they are all sorted.

So I will color them green.

So in the next video, we're just going to start with an array that looks like this.

I'm only going to have two that are out of place.

So we can go through this a lot faster.

And we will pick up here in the next video when we code insertion sort.
