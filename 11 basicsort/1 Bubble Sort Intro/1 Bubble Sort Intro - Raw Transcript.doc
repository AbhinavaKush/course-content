So Bubble Sort is going to be our first sorting algorithm.

It's probably the easiest one that we're going to do.

So I'm going to bring up an array like this.

Except I'm going to show it like this.

And I had previously shown arrays as being green.

And what I'm going to do with the sorting algorithms is I'm not going to show them as green until they

are sorted.

So anything that's unsorted, we will make blue.

So I'm going to go ahead and put this back to explain bubble sort.

So it works like this.

We're going to start with the first item.

I'll highlight that in orange.

And we're going to compare the first item with the second item.

And if the first item is bigger than the second item.

We're going to switch them.

Now we're going to compare the second item with the third item.

And if it's bigger we switch them.

But in this case it's not.

So now we move to the third item.

We compare it to the fourth item and it's bigger.

And we compare it to the next one and the next one.

And now the six is sorted.

That is the correct spot for the six.

Whatever the largest item is, we're going to bubble that all the way up to the top.

So that took five steps to get that all the way to the end and a six item array.

Then we start over and we compare 2 to 4, 4 to 5, 5 to 1, 5 to 3.

And now the five is in the correct spot.

So now the second biggest item.

Has been bubbled up to the top, but that only took four steps.

So each time we go through this, it will take fewer steps, but it is still pretty inefficient.

So we'll do this again.

2 to 4, 4 to 1.

Compare four with three.

The four is in the correct spot.

The next round will only take two steps, so we'll compare two with one, and then we'll compare two

with three.

And now three is in the right spot.

And on the last one we just compare these two.

And if they need to be switched we switch them.

If not these two are now in the correct spot.

So I'm going to go ahead and mix these back up like this.

We will pick up here in the next video where we code Bubblesort.
