Okay.

So now we're going to code selection sort.

We're going to pick up right where we left off in the last video with this array I'm going to shrink

it down into the corner here.

So we have room for our selection sort function.

So we're going to pass this an array.

And I'm going to create that min variable that we used in the last video.

And then we're going to have our for loop in this six item array.

We only had to go through this five times.

So we're going to have it run the length minus one.

So let's bring this back up here.

I is going to be zero when we first start, it's going to be that first item.

So when we set min equal to zero, when we're walking through the example, we were really setting it

equal to I.

So the first thing that we're going to do is set min equal to I.

And this is the I from the for loop.

And now we're going to do our for loop that is inside of the for loop.

So we're going to let j equal I plus one.

So I'm going to just bring this up.

This was I this is I plus one that's going to be J.

So we're going to set min equal to I, which is in this case zero.

Then we're going to say if the item that's at the index of J, if it is less than the item at the index

of min.

We're going to set min equal to J.

So let's code that and bring our code back like this.

It's going to be this if statement.

If the value at j is less than the value at min, we are going to set min equal to j.

So let's put this back like this.

In this case J is going to be one.

Then as that second for loop runs J is going to move across the array like this until it finds an item

that is less than the value that we have stored at the index of min.

So in this case it is.

So now we're going to make min equal to j again which is equal to four.

And then we go to the end and we're done looping through the array for that first time.

Then we set min equal to four.

And then we need to swap.

I.

And men.

Then that item at the index of zero is sorted.

So I will color that green.

So I'm going to shrink this down and add the code to be able to swap those two items after we run through

the for loop like this.

And this is similar to the swap that we did in the bubble sort.

So I won't walk through this in any detail, but there is something that we need to add to this.

And to illustrate that, I'm going to bring this back up.

And on the second time through this, this is going to be I and this is going to be J.

Now you can just look at this and see that the two is going to be the lowest item there.

So we're going to start out setting min equal to I, which in this case is going to be one.

And then the j is going to loop through the rest of the items.

But nothing is going to be lower.

So when this is done min is one.

An I is equal to one.

So now we know the item at the index of one is in the correct spot.

So I'm going to color that in green here.

But what we don't want to do is run these three lines of code that swap I and min because they're the

same item.

We only want to run these three lines of code when I and min are not equal.

So we'll wrap this in an if statement that says if I and min are not equal, then run these three lines

of code.

So let's bring back the rest of our code here.

The only thing left to do is to return the array.

But of course, once we get down to this line, we will have run through all of this and have a completely

sorted array that looks like this.

So we'll look at this code in a moment in Chrome Dev Tools, and we will look at the six item array

that we started with that looked like this.

So now let's flip over to dev tools.

Okay.

So there is our selection sort function.

And we're going to run selection sort on this array here.

And we'll zoom out and run this.

And there is our sorted array.

And that is our function for selection sort.
