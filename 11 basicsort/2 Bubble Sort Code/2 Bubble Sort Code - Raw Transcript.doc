So we're going to set I equal to the length minus one.

So remember the first time we went through it was five times.

Even though we had six items.

And then we're going to decrement each time, because the next time we want to go through four times,

then three times, etc..

And the second for loop.

We're going to go while J is less than I.

So this makes it where the first time through we're only going through five comparisons, and then the

next time four and three because we're doing it while J is less than I.

So for the comparisons, we're going to say if.

The item at j is greater than j plus one.

So this is going to be j the first time through our loop.

And this is j plus one.

And in this case we are going to switch them.

And this is what we'll use to switch them.

Let's walk through this.

We're going to say let temp equal array j.

So that's temp is equal to this value.

J equals j plus one is going to take that two and move it over.

And then j plus one equals temp.

Is going to put that value there.

So that's going to switch those two values.

And then after we get done running through these four loops, the only thing left to do is to return

the array.

So let's go take a look at this code in DevTools.

And for the array that we're going to pass it I'm just going to put this back the way it was.

It's going to be the array in this order.

So let's flip over to DevTools and take a look at this.

So there is our function there.

And that's the array that we're going to sort.

So the only thing we have to do is to hit run.

And then we come down here and this is the array that gets returned one through six.

And that is how we code bubble sort.
